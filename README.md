# Todo List

A very simple todo list using only bootstrap and Angular. 
This small app does very simple two-way data binding to add/remove items from an array. 
A model class is used for defining content of type string and completed being either 
true or false boolean value. It incorporates three class methods: One of these methods 
is for toggling on and off if a task is complete and given a strike-through effect if you 
click on the text. Another using a filter method to delete items. And an add method to 
push some text-input the user writes into an array called inputTodo which is then 
iterated on using an ngFor structural directive.
